# New Mexico Election Shapefile
New Mexico precinct shapefiles with election results from 2016 and 2018

## Data Sources

The New Mexico precinct shapefile was obtained from the New Mexico [Resource Geographic Information System (RGIS)](http://rgis.unm.edu/rgis6/) , which is managed by the Earth Data Analysis Center (EDAC) at the University of New Mexico. It was processed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG).

The Congressional, State Senate and State House district map shape files, as well as the 2010 census block shape file are from the [US Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Program](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html). 

Precint level elections returns were provided by the  [New Mexico Secretary of State's](https://www.sos.state.nm.us/voting-and-elections/election-results/past-election-results-2018/) website. Block level demographic data is from the Census API.

## Processing 

Statewide election returns from 2016 and 2018 - from the New Mexico Secretary of State - were cleaned by MGGG staff in order to join it with the New Mexico precinct shapefile. Census block data was aggregated to the precinct level using MGGG's [proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup).
